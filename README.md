# End-to-End Deep Learning Pipeline with MLOps: Cancer Classification using CT Scans üöÄ

This repository showcases an **end-to-end deep learning project** implementation focused on **chest cancer classification** using CT scan images. We leverage **MLOps tools** like **MLflow** and **DVC (Data Version Control)** for robust experiment tracking, data versioning, and model management, alongside **CI/CD** pipelines for seamless deployment to **AWS**. The pipeline spans from **data ingestion** to **production deployment**, covering all critical stages of the machine learning lifecycle, including model evaluation and deployment.

   - A well-structured project layout with modularized codebase.
   - Programmatic template creation to standardize components for **data ingestion**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.
   - Configurable architecture for seamless scaling.

### 2. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**
   - Automated pipeline to ingest CT scan image datasets.
   - Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, augmentations, and data normalization.
   - Source data is retrieved from Google Drive, with detailed metadata tracking using **DVC**.

### 3. **Base Model & Custom Model Training**
   - Initial base model training followed by enhanced **CNN architecture** for image classification.
   - Use of **TensorFlow** for model building, with MLflow logging for every experiment.
   - **Hyperparameter tuning** to find the best configuration using **grid search** and **random search**.

### 4. **Experiment Tracking & Management**
   - Integrated with **MLflow** for tracking model parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
   - **DagsHub** as a collaborative platform for visualizing experiments and sharing results with the team.
   - Comparison of multiple experiment runs to select the best-performing model.
